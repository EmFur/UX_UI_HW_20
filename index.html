                    <h6>The Problem</h6>
                    <p>When group expenses arise during trips with friends or family, travelers are often forced to
                        utilize multiple tools to record, split, charge, and pay group members. This can easily distract
                        and disturb travelers from enjoying the time being spent with the ones they love.</p>

                    <p>SPLITz is a travel assistance tool that allows travelers to take care of their group expenses all
                        in one app. record, split, charge, and pay your trip members in one app without wasting time
                        going through multiple apps.</p>

                    <p>In this project, the team was tasked to come up with an idea for a travel assistance app that
                        will help travelers as restrictions begin lifting post-pandemic. I was assigned to establish the
                        onboarding flow of the app, going from the user opening the app, logging in or creating an
                        account, and ending on the user dash. The team collaborated on the user research, defining the
                        problem, and coming up with the solution, but then we split ways to each iterate wireframes and
                        prototypes of our respective task flows. </p>

                        with a
                        group, as well as their chosen/go-to method. We conducted 4-6 interviews in-person, over the
                        phone,
                        and/or on Zoom.
                        There was a trend in our users that claimed they prefer not to be the one planning the group
                        trips when
                        they happen because of the complexities money brings into the process.</p>

                    <p>We have observed that existing products and methods aren't able to streamline the process of recording, requesting, and paying back split expenses, which is causing travelers to use multiple tools to accomplish these often necessary tasks. This may disturb them from enjoying the vacation experience and cause an increase in stressors that are associated with money during a trip.

                    <p>I started the prototyping phase by first establishing the potential user flow of our product. My
                        section was the onboarding flow, so the prototype will have to support the 'teach the user' phase,
                        creating an account, and easing them into the dashboard and showing them what is possible with this
                        app.</p>

                        <li>The icon in the top-left navigation bar should stay consistent. Some users were thrown off by the change in icons (menu vs home), which thwarted them from smoothly navigating between the Home Page and the Group Dashboard.</li>
                        <li>Each feature (for this test, it was the Linked Accounts page) should have another button or an access point other than the one in the menu. One suggested that we add widgets to the home page below the groups list as another visual que.</li>
                        <li>Offer an option to Link an Account in the onboarding process so that the user will know that it's a feature and an option that is offered on this product. </li>

                    <p>Going into the mind of the user. Especially at the beginning, it was very difficult for me to truly grasp what is important when brainstorming user-focused ideas. I got too hung up on all the amazing ideas that I was having for the app, that I was not truly trying to align with the user's needs. Now, I understand that the beginning brainstorms are especially important to build the foundation of user-friendly service and features. </p>

When going through this project, I found that there are many different tools that can be used to perform the same tasks, and different people preferred different things. It is important to have an understanding of how to use the tools your team members are using, but at the end of the day, I should use the tools that I am most comfortable with to produce the highest quality work.</p>

                    <p>Research your Competitors. Nothing I design will truly be original - so reference everything that you see. The patterns and functions that you see in your competitors are there for a reason. Everyone has similar things because it works. Research them and don't be afraid to implement them into your own work (without plagiarizing, of course). </p>
